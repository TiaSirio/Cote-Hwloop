# Instances of satellite configurator
# For each satellite define a DAG that represents the order of execution of the tasks
# For each task we have the following:
# - The same values as for tasksDAG.yaml
# - Dependencies -> Generated if we have as argument the name of another task.
#                   If a task have one or more dependencies, it needs to wait for the completion of the dependencies
