# Communication Simulation Software

**Dependencies**

* A C++11 compiler
* CMake for building Makefiles

## Directory Contents

* [channel](channel/README.md): The `Channel` class manages simulation of a
  communication channel.
* [channel-type](channel-type/README.md): The `ChannelType` enum class
  enumerates the channel types: downlink, crosslink, or uplink.
* [constants](constants/README.md): The constants header file collects constants
  from various references.
* [date-time](date-time/README.md): The `DateTime` class implements ISO 8601 and
  represents the Gregorian date and UT1 time in the format
  `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSSSS`.
* [edge](edge/README.md): The `Edge` class represents an edge in a graph.
* [ground-station](ground-station/README.md): The `GroundStation` class manages
  simulation of a ground station and acts as a base class for different kinds of
  ground stations.
* [isim](isim/README.md): The `ISim` abstract class defines an interface for
  simulation.
* [log](log/README.md): The `Log` singleton acts as a central object for all
  event and measurement logs.
* [log-level](log-level/README.md): The `LogLevel` enum class enumerates the log
  levels.
* [receive](receive/README.md): The `Receive` class manages simulation of a
  receiver and acts as a base class for different kinds of receivers.
* [satellite](satellite/README.md): The `Satellite` class manages simulation of
  a satellite and acts as a base class for different kinds of satellites.
* [sensor](sensor/README.md): The `Sensor` class manages simulation of a sensor
  and acts as a base class for different kinds of sensors.
* [transmit](transmit/README.md): The `Transmit` class manages simulation of a
  transmitter and acts as a base class for different kinds of transmitters.
* [utilities](utilities/README.md): The utility functions provide general
  calculations, conversions, and algorithms.
* [vertex](vertex/README.md): The `Vertex` class represents a vertex in a graph.
* [README.md](README.md): This document
